# Finhay Market

Read-only market data via the Finhay Securities Open API. All requests are signed `GET`.

## Pre-flight 
**IMPORTANT**: Run pre-flight checks before any API call. This ensures credentials are set up.

See [pre-flight checks](./_shared/preflight.md). Required: `FINHAY_API_KEY`, `FINHAY_API_SECRET`.

## Making a Request

Use [request.sh](./_shared/scripts/request.sh) for every call.

```bash
./_shared/scripts/request.sh GET /market/stock-realtime "symbol=VNM"
./_shared/scripts/request.sh GET /market/stock-realtime "symbols=VNM,VIC,HPG"
./_shared/scripts/request.sh GET /market/stock-realtime "exchange=HOSE"
./_shared/scripts/request.sh GET /market/financial-data/gold
./_shared/scripts/request.sh GET /market/price-histories-chart "symbol=VNM&resolution=1D&from=1609459200&to=1704067200"
./_shared/scripts/request.sh GET /market/financial-data/macro "type=CPI&country=VN&period=YEARLY"
```

Details & response shapes: [references/endpoints.md](./references/endpoints.md).

## Constraints

See [shared constraints](./_shared/constraints.md), plus:

- **Stock realtime** — pass exactly one of `symbol`, `symbols`, or `exchange`. Never combine them.
- **Price history** — `from` and `to` are Unix timestamps in **seconds**, not milliseconds. If a value exceeds 9,999,999,999, stop and ask the user to convert. `resolution` must be `1D`. When not provided, default `to` to now and `from` to 5 years ago.
